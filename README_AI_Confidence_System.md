# AI-Powered eBay Coin Confidence Scoring System

## Overview

This system combines eBay API data collection with intelligent confidence scoring to provide accurate coin pricing analysis. It uses AI (Google Gemini) to analyze how well each eBay listing matches your search criteria, giving you confidence scores that help you make better pricing decisions.

## üéØ Key Features

- **AI-Powered Confidence Scoring**: Uses Google Gemini to analyze listing relevance
- **Rule-Based Fallback**: Works without API keys using intelligent rule-based scoring
- **Weighted Price Analysis**: Calculates confidence-weighted averages and statistics
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Provides detailed analysis with recommendations
- **Multiple Analysis Modes**: Analyze existing data or collect new data

## üìÅ Files Overview

### Core Files
- **`API-Ebay.py`**: Main eBay API integration for collecting sold item data
- **`AI_Confidence_Scorer.py`**: AI-powered confidence scoring system
- **`Analyze_Existing_Data.py`**: Analyzes previously collected data files
- **`Integrated_Ebay_Analyzer.py`**: Combines API collection with confidence scoring
- **`test_confidence_scorer.py`**: Test script to demonstrate functionality

### Data Files (Generated)
- **`ebay_sold_items_*_FILTERED.json`**: Filtered eBay listings
- **`comprehensive_analysis_*.json`**: Complete analysis results with confidence scores

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Basic Setup (Rule-Based Scoring)

```bash
# Test the confidence scorer with existing data
python test_confidence_scorer.py

# Analyze existing data files
python Analyze_Existing_Data.py
```

### 2. Enable AI-Powered Scoring

1. Get a Google Gemini API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Update `AI_Confidence_Scorer.py`:
   ```python
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-actual-gemini-api-key-here"
   ```
3. Run the analysis again for AI-enhanced results

### 3. Collect New Data and Analyze

```bash
# First, collect new eBay data (requires valid eBay OAuth token)
python API-Ebay.py

# Then analyze with confidence scoring
python Analyze_Existing_Data.py
```

## üìä Understanding Confidence Scores

### Score Ranges
- **90-100%**: Excellent match - highly reliable for pricing
- **80-89%**: Good match - reliable with minor variations
- **70-79%**: Fair match - usable but consider carefully
- **Below 70%**: Poor match - exclude from pricing decisions

### What the AI Analyzes
- **Year Match**: Does it match the specified year (2004)?
- **Coin Type**: Is it the right coin (Silver Eagle vs other coins)?
- **Grade Match**: Does it match specified grade (MS69, MS70, etc.)?
- **Condition**: Is it the actual coin or just accessories/boxes?
- **Red Flags**: Wrong items, damaged goods, accessories only

## üí∞ Pricing Analysis Features

### Weighted Statistics
- **Weighted Average**: Prices weighted by confidence scores
- **Median Price**: Middle price when sorted
- **Percentiles**: 25th and 75th percentile prices
- **Price Range**: Minimum to maximum prices
